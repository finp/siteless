# siteless

You've heard of serverless, this is the content management equivalent.

1. Read the [site](https://finp.github.io/siteless/)

2. Learn patternfly, edit and build from `src` to generate output in `docs` directory.

3. You skipped step 2, didn't you? That's ok, just edit the `adoc` files in the `docs` directory.
